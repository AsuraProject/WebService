# ASURA WEB SERVICE

This project is already archived (2017) and has not been finalized, however, it is maintained on Github (and I am creating a README) due to nostalgia =)

The purpose of this website, developed in PHP / JS / Material Design, using an API method to store .js programs for Asura Glass (an old project of mine, which was not forward, which was intended to be a smartglass that could allow the download of applications programmed in .JS).

**Ps:** There are security flaws and old codes as it was one of my first codes as an API with PHP and Javascript (2017).
